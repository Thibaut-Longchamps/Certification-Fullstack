# wildfire-fs-project
Final project of data fullstack JEDHA's bootcamp

Welcome to our project of computer vision:

The aim of this project is to be an aid to wildfire detection. This application accepts as input files in (png, jpg) format and photos from portable devices. Take a photo of a wildfire, confirm the selection and an interactive map will open with your position and real-time weather information for the area. 



We used the D-Fire Dataset, built by:
Pedro Vinícius Almeida Borges de Venâncio, Adriano Chaves Lisboa, Adriano Vilela Barbosa: An automatic fire detection system based on deep convolutional neural networks for low-power, resource-constrained devices. In: Neural Computing and Applications, 2022.
