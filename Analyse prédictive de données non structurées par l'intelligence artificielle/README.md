Welcome to this Spam detector project!

The main objective of this project is to address one of the key challenges faced by AT&T users - the continuous exposure to spam messages. Although AT&T has been manually flagging spam messages, they are now seeking an automated solution to detect and flag spam messages in order to protect their users. The task is to develop a spam detector that can automatically identify and flag spam messages based solely on their content.

You will find in the 'spam_detector_model' file the preprocessing notebooks as well as the deep learning algorithm.
The data is available in the file: 'spam.csv'
